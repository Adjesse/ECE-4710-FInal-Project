# ECE-4710-FInal-Project

For this project, the task was to create a digital system that performs a meaningful function. 
Our team decided to design a system that could communicate with an external electronic control unit (ECU) simulator board. 
This board was designed to simulate an ECU using Keyword Protocol (KWP200). For the project, we used the Digilent Nexys A7-100T: FPGA Trainer Board. 
The Nexays board in this case would be the tester and the simulator board would be the vehicle. 
Please download the Report files to read about the specifics of the project. The report goes into depth about the individual componets of the project.
The PowerPoint Slides were created for presentation purposes. At the end there is a demosrtation video.
